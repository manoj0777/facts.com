                <p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> Everywhere.<br>

              <strong>  Explanation:</strong>  The Universe started with a “Big Bang” about
                13.7 billion years ago, and it has been expanding ever since. 
                The center of this expansion is everywhere. No matter where you are 
                in the Universe, everything will seem to be expanding or moving 
                away from you at the same rate.</p>

                <p><strong>Short Answer:</strong>You will die. <br>

                
            <strong> Explanation:</strong>  At the equator, the surface of the Earth and 
                everything on it is rotating at 465 meters per second. This speed 
                gradually decreases as you proceed closer to the pole. As soon as 
                Earth stops rotating, everything on the
                Earth (except at the pole) would continue moving as it had been.</p>

                <strong>  Explanation: </strong> It’s already been done. The Russian cosmonaut 
                Sergei Krikalev time traveled into his own future by 0.02 seconds.
                He spent 803 days, 9 hours, 39 minutes orbiting our planet. 
                Traveling at 17,500 miles per hour, he experienced an effect 
                called time dilation.</p>

                <p><strong>Short Answer:</strong>Yes. <br>

                <strong> Explanation:</strong>   Guns don’t require oxygen to work, so the vacuum 
                of outer space will not be a problem. The gunpowder is completely 
                self-contained and doesn’t depend on the atmosphere. The gun will 
                work better in space. The bullet will not have to compress or push 
                air in the barrel, and it can travel infinite distances in space.</p>

                <p><strong>Short Answer:</strong>Nothing .<br>

           <strong>    Explanation:</strong> </p>strong> There are more than 7 billion humans on Earth. That means total human 
                weight could be approximately 7*80 billion kg. However, the total mass of the Earth 
                is 5.9*1024 kg, which is comparatively way too high. According to Sir Newton, there 
                is always an equal and opposite reaction to every action. So technically,
                 there will be a tiny impact.<br>
                    If all of us get together at one location and jump 30 cm above ground at the exact same time, we would
                    push the Earth away from us about 5.3*10-14 meters, which 1/100th of the width of a single hydrogen atom.
                     And when you get back on the ground, the Earth would move back to its previous position.</p>
